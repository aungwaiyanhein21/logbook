# Logbook Application

<p>
    This application helps airline pilot to record their flying hours easily. Pilots no longer need to spend time adding their flying hours manually.

<h2>Form</h2>

<p>
    Pilots can fill out their flight sectors through the form. 
</p>

<h2>Table</h2>

<p>
    The application will calculate the total flight hours for the pilot. The pilot can then filter those flying hours based on year or month.

## Motivation
<p>
    The pilots that I know in my country have been manually adding up flying hours and keeping records in the physical logbook.
</p>
<p>
    I would like to help them out by creating an application that would take care of calculation that pilots no longer need to do manually.
